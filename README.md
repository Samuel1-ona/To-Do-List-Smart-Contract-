#ToDO List Smart Contract 


The ToDo list smart contract facilitates task management with three essential functions: adding a new task, updating an existing task, and deleting a task from the list.



























# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```
